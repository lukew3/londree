* I think that a react native app should be created instead of flask templates
  * This way, we could deploy to mobile and web with one codebase

* Remove users from the database, there is no reason for users to have an account
  * Making users sign up before using means that they will be more likely to decide
  not to use the service once they see that they have to sign up
  * To keep track of users so that they don't spam, you could keep track of ip,
  or give each device a unique code of sorts

* Consider using a remote sql database
  * I thought about mongo, and it seems that the schema would be easier in sql

* Show figma designs

* Show the react-native app
