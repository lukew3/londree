Thoughts:
If users don't have to put in their machine number, how do you keep track of which machines users are using (this feels like a stupid question)
Should users be able to get in line, and get notified when a machine is opened, one-at-a-time
How do you indicate if a machine is out of order?


If mongodb:
-----------
Collection of laundromats

Laundromat
* _id - ObjectId
* name - string
* washers - object
  #Don't necessarily need available/completed/in-use fields, but they would make it more efficient
  * available - int
  * completed - int
  * in-use - int
  * machines - array
    * completion-time - datetime
* dryers - object
  * available - int
  * completed - int
  * in-use - int
  * machines - array
    * completion-time - datetime


If SQL:
-------
Laundromat table
* id - int
* name - String

Machine table
* id - int
* Machine type - String, int, could be boolean if only washers and dryers
* completion-time - datetime
* reference to laundromat
* laundromat machine number/id (the number shown on the physical machine) - string or int, not sure if some laundromats use letters on their machines
* status - String or int #again, might not be necessary
